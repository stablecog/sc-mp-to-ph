# SC Mixpanel to PostHog Data Migrator

A tool for easily migrating data from [Mixpanel](https://mixpanel.com/) to [PostHog](https://posthog.com) (self-hosted or cloud)

## Disclaimer

This is **NOT an official tool**. We are not affiliated with PostHog or Mixpanel

However, if you are looking to migrate from Mixpanel to PostHog like we were - we hope you find this tool useful.

## Setup

### Mixpanel

You will need the following from Mixpanel:

- Service account username and password (with owner privileges)
- The project ID (found in settings -> overview)

You will be prompted in CLI to input these, or you can set the following env variables:

```
MIXPANEL_USERNAME=
MIXPANEL_PASSWORD=
MIXPANEL_PROJECT_ID=
# Optional override, defaults to https://data.mixpanel.com/api/2.0
MIXPANEL_API_URL
```

You can also put these in `.env` for convenience.

### PostHog

You will need the following from PostHog:

- Project API key
- Endpoint URL

You will be prompted in CLI for these, but can also set them in the environment:

```
POSTHOG_PROJECT_KEY=
POSTHOG_ENDPOINT=
```

## **WARNING** Do not use this without reading this first.

The Mixpanel export API has no pagination, the CLI will prompt you for a date range (required by Mixpanel)

If you have a very large data set, **do not try to get it all at once**

Mixpanel could rate limit you, your system could run out of memory and crash.

It's recommended to do smaller chunks at a time (dates are inclusive, so from_date=2023-03-01 and to_date=2023-03-01 will import 1 days worth of data)

# Usage

Download the latest [Release](https://github.com/stablecog/sc-mp-to-ph/releases) for your system.

## Recommended flow

The best way we found to migrate data is to do the following.

1. Disable GeoIP app in PostHog (if enabled)
2. Import events (see below)
3. In Mixpanel UI, export all users and columns as CSV
4. Import the users (see below)
5. Enable GeoIP app (if enabled)

## (Step 1) Import Events

Just run without any parameters:

`./mixpanel-to-posthog` or `./mixpanel-to-posthog.exe` if using windows.

## (Step 2) Import Users

The mixpanel Web UI allows exporting users as csv format. Select all columns, all users, get a .csv file.

Run `./mixpanel-to-posthog -users-csv-file /path/to/users-export.csv` to load all users into mixpanel
